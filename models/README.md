# ðŸ“‚ Pretrained Models for Human Pose Estimation  

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  

This folder is meant to store **pretrained models** for **HRNet** and **MediaPipe-based Human Pose Estimation**.  

However, you **do not need to manually download or train these models**, as both HRNet and MediaPipe allow you to **directly import their pretrained versions** within the provided scripts.

## ðŸ“Œ Why Are the Models Not Included?  

âœ… **Pretrained Models Available** â€“ HRNet & MediaPipe models can be **imported directly** via Python.  
âœ… **No Manual Download Required** â€“ The scripts **automatically load the required models** when executed.  
âœ… **Optimized Performance** â€“ These models are already **trained on large datasets** like COCO & MPII, ensuring **high accuracy**.  
âœ… **Lightweight & Fast (MediaPipe)** â€“ Unlike HRNet, **MediaPipe runs on CPU efficiently**, making it **faster** for real-time applications.
